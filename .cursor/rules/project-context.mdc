# ML Project Rules - Pitcher Strikeout Prediction

## Project Purpose
This is a **ML system for predicting pitcher strikeouts (SO)** in baseball games. The system:
- Scrapes pitcher data and betting odds
- Trains ML models (RandomForest, XGBoost, LightGBM, GradientBoosting)

## Code Style & Structure
- Use snake_case for function and variable names
- Use descriptive names for ML models and data processing functions
- Keep functions focused and single-purpose
- Add type hints where possible
- Use f-strings for string formatting

## Data Processing
- Always handle missing data explicitly
- Use pandas for data manipulation
- Validate data before model training
- Save intermediate results to avoid recomputation
